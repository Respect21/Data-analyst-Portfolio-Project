# POWER BI PROJECTS

#### *Project one*

## DATA PROFESSIONAL SURVEY ANALYSIS

### **Project Overview**
---
The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of key insights gathered from a global workforce survey. By visualizing and analyzing data related to job titles, salaries, happiness with salary, programming language preferences, life/work balance, and gender-based salary disparities, the dashboard aims to offer valuable insights into the state of the global workforce.

### Data Sources
Data professional Survey: This is a real life data that was collected by **ALEXTHEANALYST** which he made available in his github page the file is a excel file with the name *"Power BI - Final Project.xls"*.

### Tools
PowerBI - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks in power Query:
1.	Data loading and inspection.
2.	Handling missing values.
3.	Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

### Benefits
The analysis benefits are summarized as follows:
- Enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions based on insights derived from the global workforce survey.
- Facilitates a deeper understanding of salary structures, job satisfaction, and preferences within the surveyed population.
- Promotes transparency and accessibility of workforce-related information.
  
### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Utilize "Average Salary by Job Title" for salary benchmarking.
- Address work-life balance concerns highlighted in "Happy With Life/Work Balance."
- inform strategic workforce planning using geographical data.
- Address gender-based salary disparities from "Average Salary by Sex."
- Tailor training programs based on "Favorite Programming Language."
- Recognize and reward roles with high job satisfaction.
- Share key findings transparently with the organization.
- Encourage a culture of continuous improvement based on employee feedback.
- Use insights to guide personal professional development.
- Engage with feedback mechanisms to express concerns or suggestions.
- Align technology stacks with preferred programming languages.
- Develop training programs for the most in-demand programming languages.

### Limitations
- The dashboard provides quantitative insights but lacks the qualitative context. It may not capture the nuanced reasons behind certain trends or perceptions.
- Care must be taken to ensure that the dashboard complies with data protection and privacy regulations. Aggregated data should be used to prevent the identification of individuals.
