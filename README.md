# POWER BI PROJECTS

#### Project one

## DATA PROFESSIONAL SURVEY ANALYSIS

### **Project Overview**
---
The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of key insights gathered from a global workforce survey. By visualizing and analyzing data related to job titles, salaries, happiness with salary, programming language preferences, life/work balance, and gender-based salary disparities, the dashboard aims to offer valuable insights into the state of the global workforce.

### Data Sources
Data professional Survey: This is a real life data that was collected by **ALEXTHEANALYST** which he made available in his github page the file is a excel file with the name *"Power BI - Final Project.xls"*.

### Tools
PowerBI - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks in power Query:
1.	Data loading and inspection.
2.	Handling missing values.
3.	Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the professional data to answer key questions, such as:
- Which Countries are the Survey Takers from ?

- What is The Average Salary by Job Title ?
- What is Thier Favorite Programming Language ?
- How Happy are They With the Salary ?
- How Happy are They With Life/Work Balance ?
- What is The Average Salary by Sex ?

### Data Analysis
Include some interesting code/features worked with
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.	The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2.	Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3.	Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
